# purchase_intent_prediction
A model for predicting whether or not text indicates an intent to make a purchase of a product or service.

This model was trained using sklearn Pipeline with TfidVectorizer and LinearSVC. Training data was harvested from 1TB+ of Reddit submissions and several hundred thousand sample texts generated by ChatGPT via API. Predicted text will be classified as "buyer" or "neutral", since the model only seeks to predict POSITIVE purchase intent.
